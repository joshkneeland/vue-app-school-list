Component
    Where you load child components
    There's no core.module.ts or equivalent
    All child component are in that parent component (at least the references)

Data Obj (Happens Behind the scenes, aka implied, in TypeScript)
    Don't need to set this explicitly from anywhere else in the component
    But you would set it in the beginning
    Native JS, you do need to set these explicitly

Computed Method (Happens Behind the scenes aka implied, in TypeScript)
    But you would set it in the beginning
    Something that's automatic
    User doesn't need to do anything to do update state, it just happens
    Native JS, you do need to set these explicitly
    Everything in the computed variable is getting updated all the time

Methods
    Interactivity, actions
    User clicks on button, updates state

Vue Lifecycle Hook
    created
        when component is first created
            ex: fetch user data on create
    mounted
        finished after DOM is loaded
            ex: use this if something the DOM needs access to,
            needs the component to have already have mounted
    updated
        virtual DOM, re-render and patch
    destroyed

UI Libraries
    Vuetify

Vuex (REST Calls)
    Every module needs to have:
        SET STATE
        State
            Your data
        Actions (aka dispatch)
            Dispatching/Calling the API/backend
            Ex: getAllOrders, deleteOrders
        Mutations - Like Reducers
            Setting something inside the state
            Vue.set(state, 'orders', orders) method updates the variable 
                Replaces everything
                Go to the orders variable, replace it w/everything coming in

        GET STATE
        Getters
            Accessing the store

    Patrick Example:
        - Dispatch to getOrders
        - Promise chain - GET to the backend, resolves w/o error, then you start the mutations with state that came back from the API
        - Breakdown your mutation into separate lists, based on what the component needs

Vuex Pathify
    Plugin as a way to cut down on the amount of code needed for vuex

Good to know
    Vue doesn't use observables, it uses promises, async/await, etc
